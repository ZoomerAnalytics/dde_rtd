# DDE RTD
An Excel RTD server for connecting to DDE data sources

## Whaat, why??
Excel can connect to a DDE data source already, but its native implementation includes some nuisances, such as values remaining on sheet when the connection is lost and no way to get connection status.

This RTD server addresses some of these issues.

DDE is a legacy technology and is superseeded by RTD, however some applications still only support this protocol.
