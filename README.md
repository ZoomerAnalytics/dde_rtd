# DDE RTD
An Excel RTD server for connecting to legacy DDE data sources

# Whaat, why??
Excel can connect to a DDE data source already, but its native implementation includes some nuisances, such as values remaining on sheet when the connection is lost and no way to get connection status.

This RTD server addresses some of these issues.
